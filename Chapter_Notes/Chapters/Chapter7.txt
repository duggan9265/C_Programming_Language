\section{Basic Types}

\subsection{Numeric Types}

\subsubsection{Signed, unsigned, long, short and long long int}

C supports two fundamentally different numeric types: integer types and floating types. Integer types 
are whole numbers whereas values of a floating type can have fractional parts as well. Integer types in turn
are divided into two categories; signed and unsigned. With signed, the MSB is in fact a sign bit, 0 being 
positive and 1 being negative. By default, integer variables in C are signed by default, and one must use the 
reserved word unsigned to tell the compiler that there is no sign bit.

An integer is typically 32 bits (though this is machine dependent, bieng 16 bits on old CPUs). C also provides
long integers, which have more than 32 bits. Short integers are also available if one wants to store an 
integer in less space than normal. The different types can be combined, however, only only the following six 
combinations actually produce different types:
\begin{itemize}
\item short int
\item unsigned short int
\item int
\item unsigned int
\item long int
\item unsigned long int
\end{itemize}
\noindent Other combinations are synonyms for one of these six types. (For example, long signed int is the 
same as long int, since integers are always signed unless otherwise specified.) 
Incidentally, the order of the specifiers doesn't matter; unsigned short int is the same as short unsigned 
int. C allows us to abbreviate the names of integer types by dropping the word int. For example, unsigned 
short int may be abbreviated to unsigned short, and long int may be abbreviated to just 1ong. Typical value 
ranges for the vrious it types are given in figure \ref{fig:int_ranges}.

    \label{fig:int_ranges}
\end{figure}

The above ranges vary between compilers. To check the ranges for the various numeric types, one can check 
the limits.h header file. C99 added long long int and unsigned long long int. Both long long types are 
required to be at least 64 bits wide.

\subsubsection{Constants}

Constants can be written in decimal (base 10), octal (base 8) or hexadecimal (base 16). Integers can start
with any number except 0. Octal uses any digit between 0 and 7 and must begin with 0. Hexadecimal can
contain any digit between 0 and 9, and the letters A to F, and begin with 0x. The different forms can be 
mixed together when, e.g., adding or subtracting numbers. To force the compiler to treat a constant as a 
long integer, just follow it with
the letter L (or 1):
15L 0377L 0x7fffL
To indicate that a constant is unsigned, put the letter U (or u) after it:
15U 0377U 0x7fffU
L and U may be used in combination to show that a constant is both long and
unsigned: OxffffffffUL. (The order of the L and U doesn't matter, nor does
their case.)
Integer Constants in C99
In C99, integer constants that end with either LL or 11 (the case of the two letters
must match) have type long long int. Adding the letter U (or u) before or after
the LL or 11 denotes a constant of type unsigned long long int.

\subsection{Floating Types}

Integer types are not suitable for all applications. In many cases, we need to represent numbers with 
fractional parts or values that are extremely large or small. Such numbers are stored using floating-point 
representation, so called because the position of the decimal point can ``float.'' C provides three 
floating-point types:
\begin{itemize}
\item float
\item double
\item long double
\end{itemize}

These correspond to single-precision, double-precision, and extended-precision floating-point formats, 
respectively. The \texttt{float} type is appropriate when limited precision is acceptable, 
while \texttt{double} offers greater precision and is sufficient for most programs. 
The \texttt{long double} type provides the highest precision, but is used less frequently.

The C standard does not specify the exact precision or range of floating types, as these are machine 
dependent. Most modern systems follow the IEEE Standard 754 for floating-point arithmetic. Under this 
standard, floating-point numbers are stored in a form of scientific notation consisting of 
three components: a sign, an exponent, and a fraction (mantissa). The size of the exponent determines the 
range of representable values, while the size of the fraction determines precision.

In IEEE 754 single-precision format (32 bits), the exponent is 8 bits and the fraction is 23 bits, giving a
maximum value of approximately $3.4 \times 10^{38}$ and about 6 decimal digits of precision. Double-precision
format (64 bits) provides roughly 15 decimal digits of precision and a much larger range. The size of \texttt{long double} varies by implementation, commonly being 80 or 128 bits.

The characteristics of floating types on a given system can be obtained from the \texttt{<float.h>} header 
file. On systems that do not follow IEEE 754, the ranges and precision may differ.

\subsubsection{Floating Constants}

Floating constants may be written using a decimal point, an exponent, or both. For example, the following 
are all valid floating constants:
\begin{verbatim}
57.0   57.   57.0e0   57E0   5.7e1   570.e-1
\end{verbatim}

By default, floating constants are treated as type \texttt{double}. To force a constant to be stored as 
a \texttt{float}, append the letter \texttt{F} or \texttt{f} (e.g., \texttt{57.0F}). To store a constant as a \texttt{long double}, append \texttt{L} or \texttt{l} (e.g., \texttt{57.0L}). C99 also allows hexadecimal floating constants, although they are rarely used.

\subsubsection{Reading and Writing Floating-Point Values}

When reading floating-point values using \texttt{scanf}, different conversion specifiers are required 
depending on the type. For values of type \texttt{double}, the letter \texttt{l} must precede the conversion specifier:
\begin{verbatim}
double d;
scanf("%lf", &d);
\end{verbatim}

For values of type \texttt{long double}, the letter \texttt{L} must be used:
\begin{verbatim}
long double ld;
scanf("%Lf", &ld);
printf("%Lf", ld);
\end{verbatim}

In calls to \texttt{printf}, the \texttt{e}, \texttt{f}, and \texttt{g} conversion specifiers may be used for
both \texttt{float} and \texttt{double} values.

\section{Character Types}

The only remaining basic type is char, the character type. The values of char differ from one machine to
the next as different machines may have different underlying character sets. The most popular is the ASCII 
set. C treats characters as small integers.
